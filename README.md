About Morse Code
Morse Code is a system of communication developed by Samuel F.B. Morse that uses a series of dots and dashes to relay coded messages. Though it was originally devised as a way of communicating over telegraph lines, Morse Code is still used today by amateur radio enthusiasts and is also useful for sending urgent distress signals in emergency situations.

Once you’ve learned the meaning of the basic signals, you can begin writing and translating messages of your own.
